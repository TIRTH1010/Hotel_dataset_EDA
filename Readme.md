## Exploratory Data Analysis on Hotel dataset

### 🏨 Just finished a deep dive into an intriguing Hotel dataset, using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly! 📊 Here's a snapshot of what I uncovered during my Exploratory Data Analysis:

### Data Cleaning: I kicked things off by ensuring the dataset was in tip-top shape, addressing missing values and inconsistencies.

### Descriptive Analysis: I took a closer look at various statistical measures, giving me a clear picture of the dataset's central tendencies and spread.

### Spatial Analysis: I delved into the geographical aspect of the data, potentially examining the distribution of hotels or other spatial patterns.

### Choropleth Maps: To visualize the spatial data, I created Choropleth maps, which offer a fantastic way to display regional information.

### Assigned vs. Reserved Rooms: I investigated the differences between the assigned room and the reserved room to identify patterns and anomalies.

### Market Segment Analysis: I analyzed the dataset to determine which market segment had the highest number of bookings. 📈

### Pie Plot: To make this information even more digestible, I presented it in a pie chart.

### Average Price ADR per Night for Room Types: I calculated the average price (ADR) per night for different room types across all market segments. 💰

### Total Guest Arrival: I tracked the total number of guest arrivals for each day, providing insights into booking patterns.
